### This is a level 3 header

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](www.google.com)

Here is word in **bold** and another word in __bold__

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_

When we compile documents, we use the `rmarkdown` package

To higlight r code (that is not executable) but the put 3 back ticks at the beginning and end of text.

```
mean()
```
Here is an example of a non numbered list:
(NOTE: always indent 4 spaces between points)

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice

Here is an example of a numbered list

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice


> This is an example of a block quote
> This is a list inside a block quote
>
> 1. item 1
> 2. item 2

#use this idea for footnotes or caveats to protocols

> This is an example of a nested block quote
>
>> This line is nested

To put code in block quotes, add 5 spaces after the greater than symbol followed by r code

>     mean(x)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
